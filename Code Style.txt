Actionscript Code Style

ALWAYS TYPE:
No: var i; //wrong
Do: var i:int; //right

Basic comments in every .as file:
/*
	The Main Player class
*/
package {...}

Member variables in class should begin with '_':
public class Circle{
	var _radius:int;
}

Use 'this' when not calling defined variables/functions:

this.x = 5; //right
x += 1;  //wrong
_radius = 7; //ok
